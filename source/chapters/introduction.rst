About the Mixxx Project
=======================

Mixxx is designed by an international team of volunteer DJs who want to bring
the joy of DJing to everyone. The project is non-profit, open-source and
community driven. Together and with your help we aim to build the best DJ
software ever created.

Mixxx started as an open-source project because of demand for DJing software on
Linux, and discontent with proprietary DJ software on Windows and Mac OS X.
Today, Mixxx development is driven by the simple idea that together we can
create a better way to DJ, and that has brought Mixxx to the cutting edge.

Mixxx is the only free cross-platform vinyl control software and has the most
advanced MIDI/HID controller support via our innovative JavaScript-based
scripting engine. We are continuing to pursue new and exciting features that
give DJs more tools to create better live mixes.

Project History
---------------

Mixxx was originally created in 2002 as part of a PhD thesis on new interfaces
for DJing by Tue Haste Andersen. After releasing the project as open source,
dozens of contributors began modifying and improving Mixxx.

In 2006, a new development team lead by Adam Davison and Albert Santoni began
reorganizing the project to ensure smooth growth of both the code-base and the
number of contributors. A renewed focus on usability and stability has helped
Mixxx grow to become the most popular free DJ software in the world, receiving
over 1,000,000 downloads annually. Our committed team has worked hard to create
great DJ software, and this growth is a sign of our success.

In 2011, RJ Ryan took over as Lead Developer to successfully continue the teams
endeavor to make Mixxx a world-class DJ software.

As our user community grows, so does our development team - Over 150 developers,
artists, and translators have helped create Mixxx!

About the Mixxx Manual
======================

.. sectionauthor::
   S.Brandt <s.brandt@mixxx.org>

Some effort has been made to present the material in a way that is neither too
technical nor too dumbed-down. Take some time to look through it and you'll
find lots of hints that will enhance both your enjoyment and your productivity.

Through the manual you'll find text formatted like this:

* :menuselection:`Library --> Add new Playlist`

  This is to simplify the business of choosing commands in menus. In this
  example, the instruction means “Open the *Library* menu at the top of the
  application window and then choose the *Add new Playlist* command”.

* :guilabel:`Apply`

  This is used to indicate a certain area of the :term:`GUI`, including button
  labels, tabs, checkboxes, field names, values in selection lists etc. .

* :kbd:`STRG` + :kbd:`G`

  This is used to mark a keystroke, or a sequence of keystrokes. In this
  example, you would have to hold down the *STRG* key, then to press *G*.

* `<http://www.wikipedia.org/>`_

  Links to external websites are marked like this.

Important information in this manual are highlighted like this:

* .. note:: For anything that should receive a bit more attention.

* .. hint:: For supplementary information that lightens the work load.

* .. seealso:: For references to other documents or websites if they need
               special attention.

* .. warning:: For anything that needs to be done with caution.
